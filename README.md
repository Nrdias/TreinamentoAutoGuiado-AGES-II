This project entailed the development of a lightweight, accessible web application designed to deliver the World Health Organization's (WHO) "Self-Help Plus" (SH+) stress management course. The primary objective was to create a free and user-friendly digital platform for this evidence-based psychological intervention, known in Portuguese as "Autoajuda Mais," thereby increasing its reach and social impact.

### Technical Implementation
The application was engineered with a focus on performance, maintainability, and code quality, drawing upon standard industry practices.

Frontend Stack: The user interface was constructed using React with TypeScript. This combination provided a robust, component-based architecture while ensuring type safety, which significantly reduces runtime errors and improves code predictability. For styling, Tailwind CSS was utilized for its utility-first methodology, enabling the rapid development of a responsive, custom design with a minimal production bundle size.

Development Methodology: A rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow was implemented from the project's inception. By writing tests before feature implementation, we ensured high code coverage and functional correctness, leading to a more reliable and maintainable codebase. This practice was instrumental in guaranteeing the application's quality.

Architectural Principles: The project was architected with a strong emphasis on a clean, well-defined component interface and a clear separation of concerns. This approach simplified development, debugging, and future scaling by decoupling the UI from the application's state and logic.

Performance Optimization: A key technical requirement was to ensure the application remained "lightweight" to support users with older, low-specification devices. This was achieved through careful dependency management, optimized asset delivery, and leveraging efficient rendering patterns in React, resulting in fast load times and a smooth user experience.

### Project Significance
Developed during my fourth semester, this project was a practical application of professional software engineering principles to a socially impactful initiative. While the technical scope was focused, it was an opportunity to implement industry-standard practices like TDD and clean architecture to solve a real-world challenge: democratizing access to mental health resources.
